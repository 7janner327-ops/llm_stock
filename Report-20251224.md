- Stock hit record highs post-earnings
```

**Qualitative Analysis:**

**Investment Thesis**: Broadcom is emerging as the leading alternative to NVIDIA in custom AI chips, with record Q4 results driven by 74% YoY growth in AI semiconductor revenue. The company expects AI revenue to double in Q1 to $8.2B, positioning it as a prime beneficiary of data center buildout.

**Competitive Moat**:

- Custom AI accelerator design wins (OpenAI reportedly new $10B customer for 2026)
- Leading position in Ethernet AI switches
- Diversified revenue (semiconductors + infrastructure software)
- Strong relationships with hyperscalers

**Growth Drivers**:

- AI chip market share growing from 11% to projected 24% by 2027
- Custom ASIC market expanding as alternative to NVIDIA GPUs
- Data center networking riding AI infrastructure wave
- VMware acquisition synergies

**Key Risks**:

- High valuation multiples vulnerable to execution miss
- NVIDIA dominance could limit ASIC share gains
- Customer concentration in hyperscalers
- Cyclical semiconductor exposure
- Integration risk from VMware deal

**Valuation Opinion**: Fair to slight premium. While P/E of ~30x is elevated, the visible AI revenue doubling and custom chip momentum justify premium. Market cap added $135B in single day post-earnings shows strong conviction.

**Catalysts**:

- Continued AI chip design wins and customer additions
- Q1 FY25 results showing AI revenue doubling
- Market share gains in AI networking
- VMware cross-selling success

**Rating**: **STRONG BUY**
**Position Sizing**: 4-5% (high conviction)
**Entry Strategy**: Strong momentum, wait for 5-10% pullback or enter on any dip below $320

- YTD: +45.3% 
- Recent month: +1.8%
- Relative Strength: STRONG
```

**Qualitative Analysis:**

**Investment Thesis**: Micron is at an inflection point with HBM (high-bandwidth memory) fully booked through 2025, positioning it as a critical AI infrastructure supplier. CEO cited “best competitive positioning in company history” entering 2025.

**Competitive Moat**:

**Valuation Opinion**: Fair value. Trading at reasonable multiples given 93% revenue growth and strong forward outlook. Cyclical recovery provides asymmetric upside.

**Catalysts**:

- Q1 FY25 earnings (guidance raised)
- HBM capacity ramp
- Memory pricing stabilization/improvement
- AI adoption accelerating

**Rating**: **STRONG BUY**
**Position Sizing**: 3-4% (high conviction)
